# Welcome to the Homepage for our Cloud Computing Project

As most software engineers know, as codebases develop, new bugs are constantly being introduced and are often hard to detect and fix. We would like to propose a git based application that - from a specific repository - pulls multiple past code commits, and runs a series of tests on each build in order to determine which commit in the commit history is responsible for a specific bug. These tests would be deployed on separate AWS Lambda instances to allow this testing to occur in parallel, saving engineers valuable time.

This repository will be holding all the deploying and testing code:
  - *create_random.py*: Python script to create a specified array length of random intergers and writing the array and sorted array to files.
  - *name_of_git_clone_script*:

We will be using the following [repository](https://github.com/LionelEisenberg/CloudComp-Testing/) for to hold the code that we will be using our application on. For more specifics please see the README for that repository, but to summarize we have a rather basic python script that sorts an array of intergers and prints
