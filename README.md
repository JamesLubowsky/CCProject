# Welcome to the Homepage for our Cloud Computing Project

As most software engineers know, as codebases develop, new bugs are constantly being introduced and are often hard to detect and fix. We would like to propose a git based application that - from a specific repository - pulls multiple past code commits, and runs a series of tests on each build in order to determine which commit in the commit history is responsible for a specific bug. These tests would be deployed on separate AWS Lambda instances tp allow this testing to occur in parallel, saving engineers valuable time.
